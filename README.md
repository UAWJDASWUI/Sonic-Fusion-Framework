Sonic Fusion Framework is a fan-made non-profit Sonic Framework for TurboWarp, not affiliated with SEGA. Our goal is to put all good Sonic engines/frameworks in 1 while also adding brand new content and keeping the code clean and easy to understand.

We fuse content from the following Engines:
- Crabmeat Framework
- Delta Framework
- Retro Sonic Engine

And more to come. Subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mWh_T6l0bVcCIJywAKQuQ) to stay updated about the latest version.
